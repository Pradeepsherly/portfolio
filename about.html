           <h2 class="heading">Beyond the Screen</h2>
           <p class="desc">       
          While I spend a considerable amount of time behind a computer screen,
          I have a life beyond coding as well!
          Embracing these passions rejuvenates my mind and fosters creativity in
          unexpected ways
           </p>
           <h2 class="heading">Programming Languages:</h2>
            <p class="desc">       
          As a college student with a passion for technology, I've developed a
          diverse skill set that encompasses several programming languages and
          web development. Let me share a bit about my knowledge and experience
          in each area:
            </p>
            <h3> C Programming: </h3>
            <p class="desc_pro">         
          C is where my journey in programming began. It is a powerful and
          foundational language, known for its efficiency and versatility. I've
          honed my skills in C by tackling algorithmic challenges, developing
          console-based applications, and gaining a deep understanding of memory
          management. Working with C has taught me the importance of precision
          and optimization in coding, which has influenced my approach to other
          languages as well.
            </p>
            <h3> C++ Programming: </h3>
            <p class="desc_pro">     
          Building upon my knowledge of C, I ventured into C++, a popular
          object-oriented extension of C. With C++, I've explored the principles
          of object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows me to design
          modular and reusable code. My experience with C++ includes developing
          desktop applications, implementing data structures and algorithms, and
          leveraging its robust standard library to enhance the functionality of
          my projects.
            </p>
            <h3> JAVA    : </h3>
            <p class="desc_pro">        
          Java is another language I've delved into extensively. Renowned for
          its "write once, run anywhere" capability, Java has opened up the
          world of cross-platform development to me. I've worked on various Java
          projects, including Android app development, web applications using
          Java Servlets, and backend services using Spring Framework. Java's
          object-oriented nature and robust ecosystem have enabled me to create
          scalable and efficient solutions.
            </p>
            <h3> Python   : </h3>
            <p class="desc_pro">   
          Python holds a special place in my heart as a versatile and
          beginner-friendly language. I've used Python in a wide range of
          applications, from data analysis and machine learning to scripting and
          web scraping. Its readability and expressiveness make it an excellent
          choice for prototyping and building quick solutions. I am continuously
          exploring Python libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, Pandas,
          TensorFlow, and Django, to enhance my capabilities in data science and
          web development.   
            </p>
            <h3> Web Development   : </h3>
            <p class="desc_pro">       
          Web development has been a fascinating journey for me, as it allows me
          to blend my programming skills with creativity to build interactive
          and dynamic websites. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          the core trio that forms the foundation of web development. I've
          created responsive and visually appealing websites, incorporating
          modern web technologies and frameworks like React and Node.js.
          Understanding both front-end and back-end development has enabled me
          to design full-stack web applications.
            </p>
